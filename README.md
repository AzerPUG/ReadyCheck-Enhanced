# Description and Features
AzerPUG's ReadyCheck Enhanced adds a lot of functionality to the standard (very limited) ReadyCheck system. The ReadyCheck window now also shows Raid Buffs (Int/AtkPwr/Stam), Gear Buffs (Oils/Stone/ArmorKit), Consumables (Flask/Food/Rune) and Gear Info (Durability). Just as an extra reminder of what you need to use. Time left on these buffs are tracked and displayed in green, unless they are close to running out, in which case they turn yellow. Not present buffs will be listed in red.
